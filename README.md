# Code repository for the H2020 project LEAD for Lyon Living Lab

- `/parcels` Code for parcel generation and solving a VRP problem in the Confluence area using JSprit
- `/matsim_massgt_integration` Converter for MATSim output data to be used by the crowdshipping functionality of MASS-GT

## Usage

Instructions for:
- generating of a synthetic population for Lyon based on open data
- running a transport simulation using the synthetic travel demand and MATSim
- generating parcel demand from the synthetic population
- solving a VRP with time windows based on the parcel demand using JSprit
